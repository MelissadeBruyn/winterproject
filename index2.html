	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I tried to catch up on homework that was overdue including an essay on time dilation and working on some videos. Videos A prototyping assignment was handed out a while ago about revising an app pitch video. The app was based off of studying better and getting work done in time. (Yes that's the irony here) More videos about the holiday season and other subjects were made to share among my friend group.
